Breakdown

Create a turtle
position it to the centre(0 of x-axis) and lower part(-290 of y-axis) of the screen
let the screen listen: set one-key fun=move_up, key="UP"âœ…

Create cars and let car generate randomly
create car class

create car_move function
set starting position to constant x-axis(300) and dynamic y-axis from (300 to -300)
let car move from right to left on x-axis (300 to -300)

create turtle reset & create scoreboard
when tutle hits y-axis (300), let it goto(original position)
Level: {num} increase by 1
and player levels up by time(speed) increased

detect collision with car
when turtle distance is collides with car; game over
:- game_on = False

create tutle write (Game over)
